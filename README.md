# Machine Learning Classification with WEKA

## Overview
This project explores supervised machine learning classification using the WEKA toolkit. Multiple datasets were pre-processed and evaluated using a range of classification algorithms to compare performance and suitability for different data characteristics.

The work focuses on experimental design, evaluation, and interpretation rather than model implementation from scratch.

## Features
- Dataset preparation and conversion to ARFF format
- Training and evaluation of multiple classifiers
- Comparative analysis of model performance
- Use of cross-validation and standard evaluation metrics

## Algorithms Explored
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
- Other WEKA-supported classifiers

## Project Structure
- `data/` – ARFF datasets used for training and evaluation
- `experiments/` – WEKA experiment configuration files
- `results/` – Performance summaries and outputs
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## Technologies Used
- WEKA
- ARFF data format

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Understanding strengths and weaknesses of different classifiers
- Designing fair machine learning experiments
- Interpreting evaluation metrics and results
- Handling real-world datasets with varying characteristics

## Notes
This project was completed as part of university coursework. The focus is on experimental methodology and analysis rather than production deployment.
